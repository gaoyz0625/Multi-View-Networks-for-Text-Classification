Multi-View Networks for Text Classification

This code is my implementation of the paper:
"Multi View network for text classification"

Requirements (Python 3.5 packages): 

Glove, pandas, numpy, tensorflow, sklearn, nltk

and regular expression package: re

The accuracy of the validation set is now around 80% :

It can be improved by trying:
- different optimizers
- different learning rates
- diferent regularization (dropout percentage)
- data Augmentation
